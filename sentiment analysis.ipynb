Viscose is synthetic crap texture, it's generally used in to low range quality goods. If you want to be environmental friendly it shouldn't even be produced in the first place. There are good uses for synthetics like water absorption clothes, but people dispose them even though they can be reused a number of times. 3. Organic cotton is a fraud, you can use it as a marketing term or say cottons are farmed with better biodynamics. No one in the production industry buys organic yarn. Hence you don't see high end brands using \\\"organic\\\" cotton. Cotton is is technically super advanced with a high range of  treatment and the range of textures is superior for many different types of uses.

They are however perfectly fine profiting off the image of sustainability and ethics to the tune of tens of millions. They justify their high prices with sustainability, their customers defend the company with sustainability and they are painted in the media as a sustainable, ethical, and green brand - one article even called them the epitome of sustainability. They use sustainability to justify never having sales or giving discounts, while they are perfectly happy using FOMO marketing and restocking before the actual drop time, so people were forced to order twice (the backlash for that was so big that they were forced to give a half-assed apology, you can find the whole saga on this sub). They also seemingly draw the line at customer service and often guilt customers into not returning faulty items for sustainability reasons - which is the last place sustainability should be implemented, not the first one.  Let's start with their [good on you rating](https://reddit.com/r/djerfavenue/s/7vcbQhMyUl). While they are not horrible and still better than companies that produce in sweatshops, they very much just do the bare minimum. The bar for the fashion industry is in literal hell and honestly, doing the bare minimum should not result in the accolades DA gets. It is nice on paper that they produce in Portugal (we will get to that later), but the rest of the production line is unaccounted for. They source fabrics and fibers from countries where human and worker's rights abuses are rampant - Pakistan, India, Tanzania, etc... It is nice that the last step happens in the EU, but there are a lot of workers that are unaccounted for. It's also nice that there are some certified fabrics, but dyes are unaccounted for and they use fabrics that are devastating for the environment.  My biggest gripe with them is the use of Polyester. I left a long comment [here](https://reddit.com/r/djerfavenue/s/lx62SkvkxZ) about why Polyester is so so so bad for the environment, and recycled Polyester is even worse. I don't think I need to get into the whole spiel again about why it is terrible - if you care about the environment, please read this comment and look at the sources. They also use Cupro. Cupro, on paper, is a nice vegan silk alternative, on paper a byproduct of cotton, and a recycled textile. However, we do not know if DA uses cupro from organic cotton or not (if not, that is a ton of water and pesticides) and the production uses harmful and toxic chemicals, that need to be disposed of safely. Cupro production is even banned in the US. There is no record of DA ensuring that the Curpo is made of organic cotton and that it requires manufacturers to dispose of chemicals safely.  Their quality has also massively gone down, with people reporting items arriving faulty or falling apart quickly. A lot of their items are fragile as hell, need dry cleaning (which is also terrible for the environment), and in some cases can't even be washed according to instructions. Like the Pistachio Occasion Top - people washed it according to instruction, only for the fabric to bubble up and later be told by CS that the fabric can't touch water. They also don't employ any sewing or construction techniques to make the items last longer and which you could expect at that price point, and often time you have clear signs of cost-cutting (like non-functional buttons)  Let's talk about Portugal. Portuguese garment workers receive minimum wage, which is not a living wage. The factories are not always the safest environments for the workers. The majority of workers are undereducated women, who are oftentimes forced to work overtime to make ends meet, not adequately compensated for said overtime, and lack time and resources to legally go after factories. You can read the Risk Assessment from the Fairwear Foundation. A Portuguese coworker at my old job scoffed at Portugal and fair production in the same sentence. Before people come for me, of course, Portugal is miles better than a sweatshop with child and modern-day slave labor. The bar is in hell.  I also fully believe that the workers are very overworked. We did some detective work and found out that DA orders thousands of pieces per item, from factories with 10-100 employees. The drops these days are smaller, but last year they had drops with 20+ items, meaning we have a couple dozen people working on tens of thousands of pieces. This is consistent with the quality - a good chunk of pieces I received show signs of rushed sewing, and a dress even arrived with holes that are consistent with dull needles, leading me to believe that workers don't even have time to switch needles. Sydneybmichelle has a [Tiktok](https://www.reddit.com/r/djerfavenue/comments/wjusyl/bad_stitching_via_sydneybmichelle_on_tiktok/) that is pretty much the worst stitching I have ever seen - like seriously, Shein makes better seams.  The destination Pop-ups. Not to mention the team and customers traveling there, but they also flew influencers out (at least to the LA one). They also produced a ton of custom merch, from cups, to hang tags, to a popcorn machine, disposable cameras, so much random fluff and decor, and according to people on the sub, there was litter everywhere!  One thing I find particularly annoying is that whenever they receive pushback, they take two steps backward instead of taking the criticism and improving. \\nWhen they were called out on their lack of sustainability and ethics, they just said they never claimed to be, instead of introspecting and improving. No other company would do that, the most horrifying companies on the planet manage to keep the facade up. Every single fast fashion company puts every green thing they do front and center, none of them would ever say \\\"about that... No\\\".  On the old website, they had a sustainability page, which is now in the About Us section. On the old website, they made it a point that the entire production line was done by truck (you should be able to find this on the Wayback machine). They were called out on it, because with their sourcing countries that would have been impossible. Instead of improving and working on that, they just silently removed that point.  They also used to send their clothes in paper bags but apparently had some complaints that clothes got wet, so they switched to plastic. Instead of working on a sustainable shipping method (cardboard boxes, a protective fabric bag, opt-in option for eco-friendly packaging, reusable plastic bag?? Something?), they took the easy way out.  A small bonus point for optics: I genuinely don't think they even care about the optics of sustainability anymore, as Matilda modeled with a huge plastic bag in a recent drop (and it wasn't even aesthetically pleasing, so bad on all fronts).

To your point, as much as I am excited about all the new innovative developments, we can't assume they are the perfect solution. As I mentioned in my article they are often finished with glues and foils that prevent them from being biodegradable. Bamboo is a really interesting one, I think we've all been led to believe bamboo is a sustainable alternative but the highly intensive chemical process it goes through to become clothing and bedding etc is not good for the environment. I haven't done as much research into the pineapple leather process, only that it's the pineapple leaf waste that often gets used so that's definitely a pro. The trouble with synthetic fabrics is they end up in landfill and have nowhere to go, they aren't biodegradable. As well as micro plastic pollution that occurs when it gets washed in the washing machine, which ends up in the oceans. Recycled synthetic is slightly better as you're prolonging the lifecycle, but you're still ultimately going to have the same problems. Organic cotton is always a better alternative to cotton as it uses a lot less water and pesticides. As someone that loves fashion and works in fashion, I hate to say it but the most sustainable thing you can do is buy from thrift stores, second hand, depop etc, upcycle your own garments or buy from brands who use dead-stock fabrics  (fabrics that have already been produced and discarded by other brands that would otherwise end up in landfill.)  I think the future of fashion is in the second hand market and dead-stock fabrics. I think the second hand market is predicted to overtake fast fashion in the next few years.\", \n",

I went vegan at the beginning of the year, and I was debating the ethics of buying secondhand leather (and keeping products you may have already bought). I read an article by a woman going through the same dilemma, who wrote that she kept some leather shoes, and while at an animal sanctuary, she was feeding one of the cows. A bit of food dropped onto her shoe, and the cow licked it off. She said it disgusted her, and she realised that wearing leather was completely against her morals.  I think if you wouldn't wear the skin of dogs, cats or any other animal, then why would you wear cows' skin? These days I look for other materials, but I can't speak for any vegan leather alternatives as I haven't bought any yet! \\nGreat article, though!
